## PES Open Source Projects

Consider this the main branch of projects that we have deemed to be the most accessible, well documented, and thoroughly vetted bunch of projects that are actively being worked on. These projects have their own Slack help channels.

These are run like a lot of real-world Open Source projects, and this is probably the best way to get exposed to the processes involved while working on Open Source.

The list:

- [Grofer](/projects/about-grofer)
- [Rshark](/projects/about-rshark)
- [`browser-history`](/projects/about-browser-history)

Want your project to be here? Check [this](https://pesos.github.io/projects#want-to-start-your-own-project) out!

## Other Projects To Contribute To

These are projects being maintained by members of our community, that were not accomodated by the criteria for the kind of projects listed above. These projects tend to be more niche, and smaller in scope, but can be a lot of fun to contribute to. They do not have dedicated help pages on the Slack channel, but you can still ask questions related to these much in the `#projects` channel.

We have listed the link to repo along with the Slack handle for the maintainer so you will know whom to tag when you have a query.

The list:

### [pesos.github.io](https://github.com/pesos/pesos.github.io)

Yes, this very website you are looking at is also an Open Source project (forked from [here](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme)). We appreciate any improvements for the website, and to be honest, no one in PESOS fully understands the codebase for this website. If you know how jekyll works and are comfortable with [liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/), that would be of great help!

**Tech Stack:** Jekyll, Markdown, YAML  
**Contact:** @vuhh knows the most about this codebase, but don't keep your hopes too high :p
