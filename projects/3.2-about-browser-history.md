`browser-history`  is a simple, zero-dependencies, developer-friendly python package to retrieve (almost) any browser's history on (almost) any platform.

## Usage

### History

To get history from all installed browsers:
```python
from browser_history import get_history

outputs = get_history()

# his is a list of (datetime.datetime, url) tuples
his = outputs.histories
```

If you want history from a specific browser:
```python
from browser_history.browsers import Firefox

f = Firefox()
outputs = f.fetch_history()

# his is a list of (datetime.datetime, url) tuples
his = outputs.histories
```

 - `Firefox` in the above snippet can be replaced with any of the [supported browsers](https://browser-history.readthedocs.io/en/latest/browsers.html).

### Bookmarks

To get bookmarks from all installed browsers:
```python
from browser_history import get_bookmarks

outputs = get_bookmarks()

# bms is a list of (datetime.datetime, url, title, folder) tuples
bms = outputs.bookmarks
```

To get bookmarks from a specific browser:
```python
from browser_history.browsers import Firefox

f = Firefox()
outputs = f.fetch_bookmarks()

# bms is a list of (datetime.datetime, url, title, folder) tuples
bms = outputs.bookmarks
```
